# Predicting-Multipartite-and-Unipartite-Bacterial-Genomes

This repository contains data, codes and jupyter-notebook to predict multipartite and unipartite genomes based on i) set of genes & ii) differentially present genes in respective genomes using a Machine Learning Framework, based on publication "A machine learning framework to predict antibiotic resistance traits and yet unknown genes underlying resistance to specific antibiotics in bacterial strains, Briefings in Bioinformatics, Volume 22, Issue 6, November 2021, bbab179, https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbab179."

# Running-the-program

The executable python files can be run in the terminal using the syntax

python ML_run_multipartite_gene_level.py

All the required data and the .py files need to be in the same working directory and the respective outputs are created in separate files.
