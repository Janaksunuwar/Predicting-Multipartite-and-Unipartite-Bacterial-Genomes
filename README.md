# Predicting-Multipartite-and-Unipartite-Bacterial-Genomes

This repository contains data, codes and jupyter-notebook to predict multipartite and unipartite genomes based on i) set of genes & ii) differentially present genes in respective genomes using a Machine Learning Framework, based on publication "A machine learning framework to predict antibiotic resistance traits and yet unknown genes underlying resistance to specific antibiotics in bacterial strains, Briefings in Bioinformatics, Volume 22, Issue 6, November 2021, bbab179, https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbab179."
